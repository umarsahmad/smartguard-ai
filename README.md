# 🚨 SmartGuard

**SmartGuard** is an end-to-end system for training, deploying, and testing AI models in simulated embedded environments. Built with automation and edge deployment in mind, it demonstrates how you can use Python, TensorFlow Lite, MQTT, and CI/CD (via GitHub Actions) to replicate real-world AI-on-the-edge workflows same as we do on a physical device like a Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.

## 📦 Features

- 🧠 **Train lightweight AI models** for real-time tasks (image classification, detection)
- ⚙️ **Convert & optimize** to TensorFlow Lite with quantization
- 💻 **Simulate model deployment** to an edge device on your own machine
- 🛰️ **Control inference via MQTT** like an actual IoT device
- 🧪 **Automated testing & benchmarking** (accuracy, speed, latency)
- 🔁 **CI/CD pipeline**: Model retrains, converts, deploys, and tests on every push

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / TFLite
- MQTT (paho-mqtt)
- OpenCV
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- YAML / Shell

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Helmet detection system for factory safety
- Smart camera with gesture recognition
- Real-time object detection for surveillance
- Low-latency image classification at the edge

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Flow

1. Code push triggers GitHub Actions
2. Trains model → converts to TFLite → simulates deployment
3. Automatically runs test cases + saves logs
